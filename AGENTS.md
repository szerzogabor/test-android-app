# test-android-app — agent guide

This is an **Android application**, scaffolded by EmberForge Forge.

## What CI does

On every push to `main`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
1. Builds a signed release APK (`gradle assembleRelease`).
2. Uploads it as a **GitHub Release** (tag `v1.0.<run_number>`), together
   with a slim `metadata.json` (`versionCode`, `versionName`,
   `downloadUrl`, `sizeBytes`) that the EmberForge app reads to list and
   install releases.

`versionCode` is `github.run_number`; `versionName` is
`1.0.<run_number>`.

## Ground rules

- **Do not touch `keystore/`.** CI generates this project's own
  persistent debug keystore there on the first run and commits it. Every
  build must keep signing with that same key, or installed copies can no
  longer update in place.
- The app is signed with a committed debug keystore on purpose — this is
  a demo distribution channel, not a Play Store release.

## Project layout

- `app/` — the application module (`namespace`/`applicationId`
  `com.emberforge.generated.testandroidapp`).
  - `src/main/java/com/emberforge/generated/testandroidapp/MainActivity.kt` — a single
    Compose `Activity` rendering a "Hello World" screen. Grow the UI
    from here.
  - `src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `src/main/res/` — manifest and
    resources.
- `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts` — Gradle setup (AGP + Kotlin
  + Compose compiler plugins, versions pinned).

## Building locally

```sh
gradle assembleRelease
```

There is no unit-test step in CI yet — add one (and tests) when the work
calls for it.
